# Overview

This library provides an **adjacency list based graph** implementation. Edges are represented by explicit object and can link more than two nodes.

This library is developped as part of an attempt to model and develop user-facing dictionaries with graphs. It is generic enough to be used for other purposes. You can consult the following publications for more details about the data model:

Lecailliez, L, Mangeot, M. (2018). AsiaLex 2018 publication (to be published).
